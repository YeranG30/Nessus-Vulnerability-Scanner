# Nessus-Vulnerability-Scanner

This project documents my experience with installing and using the Nessus Vulnerability Scanner on a Linux machine. It covers the step-by-step process of setting up Nessus, conducting vulnerability scans, analyzing the results, and reflecting on the learnings and future considerations for using such tools in cybersecurity.

# 1. Introduction
Nessus is a leading vulnerability scanning tool essential in cybersecurity for detecting network, system, and application vulnerabilities. Its importance for aspiring cybersecurity professionals lies in its ability to identify potential security risks, ensure compliance with various standards, and provide detailed, actionable reports. Nessus is widely used in the industry, making it a critical skill for various roles in cybersecurity. Learning Nessus not only enhances foundational skills like network scanning and vulnerability assessment but also keeps you updated with the latest security threats, making it a valuable asset for any cybersecurity career path.

# 3. Conducting Scans
- Local Host Scan (127.0.0.1)
  The Local Host Scan conducted using Nessus Vulnerability Scanner revealed two informational findings without any high-severity vulnerabilities. This brief scan, categorized under the 'Host Discovery' policy, was executed to confirm the presence and responsiveness of the local host. Leveraging the Local Scanner, the scan was initiated and concluded at 1:34 PM, efficiently completed in a matter of seconds, suggesting a controlled and possibly secure environment with minimal security risks identified at the time of the scan.

- VM Scan in Azure SIEM Project
Project Context
Within the Azure SIEM project(Take a look at my repository to find the project), the virtual machine (VM) functioned as a controlled environment for simulating security event monitoring and incident management, enabling the testing of SIEM capabilities in detecting and responding to threats. For the purpose of this scan, the VM's firewall and other security measures were intentionally disabled to create a vulnerable setup, facilitating the assessment of Nessus's ability to uncover potential risks in an unguarded state.

Scan Procedure
A Basic Network Scan was conducted using Nessus, with the VM's IP address as the target. The scan was performed using a Local Scanner, commencing at 1:43 PM and concluding at 1:55 PM, over a span of 12 minutes.

# 4. Analyzing the Results
Findings and Interpretation

<img width="841" alt="image" src="https://github.com/YeranG30/YeranG30-Nessus-Vulnerability-Scanne/assets/74067706/e576373b-d9d2-43cc-97e5-8d66ceb53961">


The scan revealed 23 vulnerabilities, highlighting 7 critical issues among them. A significant vulnerability detected was the DNS Server Spoofed Request Amplification DDoS, a common security flaw found in machines with improperly configured DNS servers. This vulnerability can be exploited to amplify DDoS attacks, with the machine acting as an unwitting participant in the attack. The identified vulnerability involves the DNS server responding to any request, which can be exploited to conduct an amplification attack. Attackers may make queries to the root zone's name servers that result in responses larger than the original requests. By falsifying the source IP address, they can amplify the volume of traffic directed at a victim, causing a denial of service (DoS). To prevent such misuse, it is crucial to limit the DNS server's exposure to public networks or modify its configuration to deny such requests, thus protecting against this common and potentially disruptive security threat. To mitigate this, it is recommended to limit the DNS server's public network access or adjust its settings to dismiss such exploitable requests.

# 6. Conclusion

Throughout this scanning exercise with Nessus, the experience underscored the critical nature of comprehensive vulnerability assessments in maintaining robust cybersecurity defenses. The scans not only revealed common vulnerabilities, such as the DNS Server Spoofed Request Amplification DDoS, but also demonstrated the ease with which an unprotected system can be assessed for risks. The deliberate deactivation of security measures on the VM within the Azure SIEM project environment provided a clear canvas to understand the importance of protective configurations.

Reflecting on the results, it's evident that regular and proactive vulnerability scanning is indispensable. It serves as both a diagnostic and a preventative measure against the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats. This exercise has reinforced the notion that a secure network is not a one-time achievement but a continuous pursuit, necessitating diligence, awareness, and the effective use of tools like Nessus to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities before they are exploited.
